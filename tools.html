        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Before we get started, we need to set you up with all the necessary tools you're going to need to get up and going. I am going to use Windows 10 to write code on but you can use any kind of
          OS. We'll get the same output. I'll try to make sure we get you in with some good tools. What's important here is that you find what works for you. Every developer has very strong opinions
          about their tools and will tell you that is some reason, you have to use their tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will suggest not to listen to them. Find what works for you. If you find yourself fighting your tools more than they're helping you, consider trying something else. Keep an open mind.
          What's shiny or popular is not necessarily going to work for you. Take time to invest in making your tools work the best for you. Small wins amount to huge boosts in productivity in the long
          term.
        </p>

        <h2>Browser Selection</h2>
        <p>
          One of your biggest allies in writing websites is the web browser. You may not be yet aware but your browser has uncountable developer tools built into it that help you understand your code,
          help you find bugs, and help you experiment directly on your running website. All of the modern browsers are great and you can use any one of them to develop sites. I recommend you pick one
          and really get to know its developer's tools.
        </p>

        <h2>My Recommendation: Chrome</h2>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Download Chrome</a>
        <p>
          I was a big fan of Mozilla for a long time and Firefox just keeps getting better day by day. The developer tools are amazing and the team behind them is amazing too. But I don't know why I
          use Chrome and all of my classes will be done using Chrome. You can also use Edge, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. Those are very very good browsers with great dev tools too. If you feel
          comfortable with one of these already, stick with it. And I believe no one is going to use Safari that's why I will not tell anything about that browser.
        </p>

        <h2>The Editor/IDE Selection</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most controversial things you can ask a developer is which editor is the best. There are so many strongly-held opinions that it's hard to tell which one is going to work for you.
          There are many flavors and it all depends on what you want out of your editor: do you want it to hold your hand as much as possible? Do you want it to get out of the way? I'm going to give
          you several choices but let's start with what I've been using for a few years now.
        </p>

        <h2>My Recommedation: Visual Studio Code</h2>
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Download VS Code</a>
        <p>
          I experimented with many Editors & IDEs since I started coding but lastly, I stuck with only two editors. One of them is <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> called
          <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">WebStorm</a> and it is premium. It's a fantastic <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> I've ever seen. If
          you want a more complete solution, you may investigate using this <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>. The reigning, best
          <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> for front-end development is WebStorm. WebStorm is a very powerful
          <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> that has a lot of features and tools built into it. It aims to be more than just an editor; it aims to be the entire development
          suite. Great tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          And VSCode editor is amazing too as a free editor. it has a lot of convenient features and helpers. To me, it's the right balance of minimalism and helpers. It works in particular really
          well with front-end development as well, and since the editor itself is based on HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. If you ever feel like adding a new feature or plugin to it, you'll already know the
          correct language to do so. It's free, open-source, and works well on Mac, Linux, and Windows. And perhaps one of the best features of VSCode is it has a huge amount of available plugins
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't feel comfortable with VSCode, two other editors that are similar in their offering are <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text 3</a> and
          <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>. Both are great. I used Sublime for a couple of years and I still like it. Both are free to download. Sublime has an unlimited trial
          period that asks you to pay $ when you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want a more complete offering, you may investigate using an integrated development environment (commonly called an IDE.) The reigning, best IDE for front end development is WebStorm.
          WebStorm is a very powerful IDE that has a lot of features and tools built into it. It aims to be more than just an editor; it aims to be the entire development suite. Great tool.
        </p>

        <h2>The Terminal</h2>
        <p>
          You're going to learn to use a terminal during this course. It's less scary than it seems, I promise! If you are confused, it's okay. We'll come back to it later. For the shell, we are going
          to use bash. You have to install it if you use Windows.
        </p>

        <h2>Trusted Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Something really important is that you choose to learn from good sources. Just like it's important to get your news from quality sources, it's important to get your technical information
          from sound sources. Here are some of my personal favorites:
        </p>
        <ul class="px-5">
          <li>
            For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" title="Mozilla Developer Network"> Mozilla's MDN</a> is my go-to. I
            literally have it open all the time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> Tricks</a>
            has fashioned itself into a premier development website. It has great content not just for
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> but for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and JavaScript too. If I want a tutorial, I'll head there. If I want more
            technical how-to info, I head to <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a></abbr
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I work with a library or a framework, it's a good idea to head directly to their <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (we'll talk about GitHub later) page or their
            official documentation. It's best to head straight to the source.
          </li>
        </ul>
