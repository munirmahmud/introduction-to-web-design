            <h2>Meta Tags in HTML</h2>
            <p>
              So far we've gone through some HTML tags that produce something concrete, something visual. Now, I am going to talk about something that is HTML too and we need them but it won't produce
              visual things.
            </p>
            <p>Let's start with the absolute basic foundations for an HTML page. Like a house needs a foundation, your HTML document needs a basic framework to get up and going.</p>

            <h3>DOCTYPE</h3>
            <code>
              <xmp><!DOCTYPE html></xmp>
            </code>

            <p>
              HTML is an old language. It was invented in 1993! While I'm sure the originators and the early adopters of HTML did their best to make what they could, there's no way they could have
              anticipated that we'd still be using it 25 years and the needs we'd have. As such, HTML has had to evolve in many unexpected ways and part of that is removing bad parts and mistakes that
              are used to HTML as we go along.
            </p>

            <p>
              When they remove the bad stuff and add good stuff, they make a new version of HTML. The way we tell the browser that's reading the HTML what version of HTML we're using is this first
              tag. This particular one is for HTML5, the latest version of HTML. HTML doesn't get revised very often so this will be the header you'll use for a long time to come.
            </p>

            <code>
              <xmp><html lang="en"></html></xmp>
            </code>
            <p>
              Everything (besides the doctype) goes into your HTML tag. You'll wrap everything in here. You also should give it a language attribute to let the browser know what language your document
              is in which is what the lang="en" is communicating. This is useful to the browser to know for a number of reasons.
            </p>

            <code>
              <xmp><head></head></xmp>
            </code>
            <div class="code-para">
              First, there's
              <code>
                <xmp><head></head></xmp>
              </code>
              and also
              <code>
                <xmp><header></header></xmp>
              </code>
              and they are different. Be careful about that. We're talking about
              <code>
                <xmp><head></head></xmp>
              </code>
            </div>

            <p>
              We'll first talk about <code>head</code>. Inside of <code>head</code> goes all of the meta-data to help the browser understand how to read your document. In our case, the only thing
              we're putting in <code>head</code> is the title of the document. What goes inside of <code>title</code> is what will the name of the tab of the browser. It's also the name of the Google
              or Bing search result.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basically, anywhere that's going to display the title of the web page will use what's inside of here. This is the theme of what goes in head: data that's useful for reasons other than
              displaying it. We can put a tag in here that prevents pinch-to-zoom on mobile if we needed that (don't do that!) We can put a tag that identifies the description and image that Google
              would use for search results. We'll see some more later but for now we'll stick with just a title.
            </p>

            <code> &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; </code>

            <p>All of our "visual" HTML will go in here. All your <code>div</code>s, <code>span</code>s, <code>img</code>s, etc.</p>

            <code>
              <xmp><script></script></xmp></code
            >,
            <code>
              <xmp><style></style></xmp></code
            >, and
            <code>
              <xmp><link /></xmp>
            </code>

            <p>
              We're about to talk about CSS and JavaScript, but know they have the above three tags, <code>script</code>, <code>style</code>, and link are used for them, <code>script</code> being used
              for JavaScript and the latter two for CSS.
