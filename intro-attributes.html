        <h2>Let's talk about Attributes</h2>
        <p>We just finished talking about what the basic building block of HTML is: tags. We're going to explore a bit more about what you can do with tags and then we'll move on to CSS.</p>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start with a text <code>input</code> tag. There are several types of <code>input</code>s that we discussed in the previous section: text, color, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. How can
          the browser tell which is meant to be what? HTML attributes! Attributes are additional pieces of information that you can attach to HTML tags. We're going to use the
          <code>type</code> attribute to pass that to the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>type</code> is considered an attribute. Different tags have different attributes that they care about. For example, the <code>type</code> attribute is not useful with
          <code>type</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>h1</code>, etc. You can still put a <code>type</code> attribute on these tags; they'll just ignore them.
        </p>
        <p>Let's explore the other <code>input</code> types</p>
        <p>
          <code>input</code>s aren't the only ones to use attributes. In fact they are used everywhere in HTML. This is just to demonstrate to you what they look like and how certain attributes do
          certain things. If something isn't working for you, always check to see if you misspelled one of the tag names or attributes; that's an easy thing to mess up and hard to tell it happened.
        </p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>
          Classes are special attributes that can go on any tag, though some you won't use it with. While a class does nothing itself, it allows that tag to be found by your CSS and your JavaScript.
          Using our house analogy, you don't want to make a rule that says "all walls are south facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's nonsensical and you could never build a house that way. Instead, you'd make a rule that says "walls marked south-facing-wall are south facing." This is what classes allow you to do:
          they allow you to mark your HTML so you can write rules and code to govern them later. Let's see what that looks like.
        </p>

        <code>
          <xmp>
            <div class="header">
              <h1 class="header-title">My Great Blog</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-posts">
              <div class="post">
                <h1 class="post-title">When Not to Overextend House Metaphors</h1>
                <p class="post-text"> … </p>
              </div>
              <div class="post">
                <h1 class="post-title">Another Great Blog Post</h1>
                <p class="post-text"> … </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </xmp>
        </code>
        <p>
          What you see above is very typical-looking HTML. Most tags will have classes. Now when I go to write CSS later, I can target just <code>post-title</code>s. If I wrote a rule targeting
          <code>h1</code>s, I'd get all the <code>post-title</code>s and the <code>header-title</code> as well. As you may imagine, you'll want the site header's <code>h1</code> to look and act
          different than the blog post title, just like the headers in this lesson look different than the "Introduction to Web Design & Development" in the header.
        </p>

        <h2>IDs</h2>
        <p>
          IDs are far less useful than classes. Whereas you'll be using classes everywhere and frequently, you should be using IDs very sparingly. As you see in our above blog-posts HTML, we can
          re-use classes like post and post-title. This is extremely important. As a coder, you want a piece of code and use it a lot. As coders, we want to write as little code as possible (which
          we'll explore why later, for now trust me.) For now, be satisfied that I get to write a little bit of code that governs post and have it affect every post on the page.
