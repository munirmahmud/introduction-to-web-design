        <h2>Introduction to the Course</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the introduction to Web Design and Development. I'm really excited to teach you a bit about how to become a web developer. In this course, we assume you know absolutely nothing
          about writing code. We do assume that you have a basic grasp of how to operate your computer: how to browse the Internet, how to operate your operating system, how to use a keyboard and
          mouse, etc.
        </p>
        <p>You should be able to skip lessons you know. However, the review can be helpful.</p>

        <h2>Tips to Succeed In This Course</h2>
        <p>
          Contrary to what many people believe, you do not have to be a wizard with math to write code. The two subjects share some overlap but also are quite different. Many artists, lawyers,
          historians, linguists, and others have great success learning how to code. Don't let those preconceived notions hold you back at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, keep in mind that this is hard. Learning how to code is hard. It's similar to learning a foreign language where you have to learn a lot of small pieces of information to be able to
          make sense of the larger picture. It's easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you should get something but don't. Keep your head up and keep trying.
        </p>
        <p>Walk away from the problem and come back later. Try explaining your problem to someone / play with Rubik's Cube / a rubber ducky Seriously, it works great.</p>

        <p>
          Never feel afraid to Google anything. Every programmer you know, from the top person in the field to the newest student is Googling things constantly. This isn't cheating; it's a skill. It's
          a requirement. There is so much information coming at you that cannot possibly remember it all. Copy and paste code. Look at StackOverflow. Ask dumb questions. You get better by repeatedly
          exposing yourself to information. Each time a bit more will sink in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't try to understand every piece all at once. There are times where it's okay to just trust that something works and come back later to understand how. It's a tough balance because you do
          want to try to understand what's going on. We will tell you what's worth diving into and what's worth leaving for another day. You don't have to understand it all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Learning to code is hard and requires a lot of hard work. While entry-level jobs are out there, and you can get them with months of work, we
          guarantee you you'll have to work hard for them.
